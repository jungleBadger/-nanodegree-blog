### side note
Personally I would not achieve this result using these technologies such templating and python. I believe that node.js would provide a very more flexible environment to perform this task.
I do know that frontend style could be very more polished and there are room from several features but I not enjoyed acting on this project using these technologies so I am aiming to pass doing the requirements and not going after excellence.
